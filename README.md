I'm a Software Engineering Undergraduate at the Rochester Insitute of Technology. I'm interested in lots of different things! Check out some of my repos on [Artificial Intelligence](https://github.com/PaprikaDev/paprika-opensource), [financial derivative pricing](https://github.com/RWalling21/black-scholes-monte-carlo), and [NBA stat tracking](https://github.com/RWalling21/Dunk-Watch) in your CLI. 

My progress in cracking the coding interview :unlock::computer:
